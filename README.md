Preparing the environment - replit (for first 15 days), coding rooms, Thonny (for debugging) etc.

Pretty easy stuff:

* printing
* string concatenation (with "+")
* single and double quotes, escape char ("\\")
* input function, comments ("#") and shortcut: CTRL+/ for toggling the comment
* variables, naming variables (no spaces - use dash "_", no numbers at the beginning)

1. Exercise 1 - Printing

2. Exercise 2 - Debugging Practice

3. Exercise 3 - Input Function

4. Exercise 4 - Variables

5. **Day 1 Project: Band Name Generator**

### Day 2

This day's content:

* data types (string, integer, float, boolean)
* strings numbered from 0 (zero!)  Hello[0] -> H, Hello[4] -> o, Hello[-1] -> o
* integer 1, 123131, 223_323_434
* float 2.3, 0.001
* True / False
* type() function
* type conversions (casting): str(), int(), float(), bool()
* casting float to int chops off the end (after the decimal point)
* operators and shorthands (+=, -=, /= etc.) 2**3 (to to power of 3)
* dividing - always float
* floor division // - result is a whole number (int)
* round()

* #### f-String

    ```python
        score = 0
        height = 2.2
        isWinning = True
        print(f"Your score is {score} and height is {height} and you are {isWinning}")
    ```

* formatting print

    ```python
        final_tip = ":.2f".format(bill_per_person)
    ```
